This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This To-Do List application now includes:
*   **Task Management**: Add, toggle completion, edit, and delete todo items.
*   **Categories**: Assign and manage custom categories for your tasks.
*   **Due Dates**: Set and track deadlines for your todos.
*   **Filtering**: Filter tasks by category and completion status.
*   **Sorting**: Organize tasks by default order, completed last, or alphabetically.
*   **Search**: Quickly find tasks by searching their text.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
